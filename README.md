# 👨‍🍳 Chef Claude

**Chef Claude** is an AI-powered recipe assistant built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to help users cook creatively using ingredients they already have at home. Originally developed as part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path, this project has been remodeled to feature real-time AI recipe generation powered by **Anthropic's Claude 3 model**.
